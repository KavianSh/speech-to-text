# speech-to-text
It is a simple speech to text app that i write with Python and its my University project

before run the code you need to install requirments packages 

run this in command to run the code:
    streamlit run "streamlit run path_of_your_project/app.py"

 If this is the first time you manipulate audio files on your linux computer, you may get some OSErrors about the libsndfile, ffprobe and ffmpeg libraries.

Donâ€™t worry, you can easily fix these errors by installing them. The command will be different depending on the OS you are using. For example, on Linux, you can use apt-get:
sudo apt-get install libsndfile-dev
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

If you have Conda or Miniconda installed on your OS, you can use:
conda install -c main ffmpeg
